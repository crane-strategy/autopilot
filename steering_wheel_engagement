Vehicle details:
Hardware: Steering Wheel
Software: Steering wheel engagement
Vehicle: Tesla Model X

How it currently works:
Force must be applied to the steering wheel to maintain autopilot. 

The problem:
When in autopilot, steering wheel cannot override movements without disengaging.
To disengage autopilot, must move the steering wheel in a way that jerks the vehicle.

Proposed solution:
The driver can make minor corrections with the steering wheel without disengaging autopilot

Experiment:
Let the steering wheel allow for some movement of the vehicle.

Wnen is this needed:
1. To avoid potholes
2. To help the driver feel more comfortable if a nearby vehicle feels to close
3. Driving near pedestrians, bicyclists, construction sites, or emergency services
4. Navigating in places where there are not lines in the road (narrow, two-lane bi-directional streets)

When would it not help:
1. If autopilot needed to avoid a crash and the override put the vehicle in a worse position. Risk of this is low.
2. In the case of an accident, the liability between the driver and the vehicle.

What are the challenges for the experiment:
1. Experimenting with the threshold in different scenarios to find optimal range.
2. Programming for when the car takes back over during override (time, conditions, etc.)
